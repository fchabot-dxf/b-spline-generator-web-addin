# Template 2 - Narrow Neck — 18-Step Linear Construction

The Frame Builder Template 2 - Narrow Neck uses a **Multi-Sketch Sequence** to ensure maximum stability and modularity. The build progresses through 18 global phases across three distinct Fusion 360 sketches.

---

## Sketch 1 — Foundations: Bounding Box
*Relationship: Defines the "Master Envelope" that all subsequent geometry projects from.*

### 🟡 Phase 1.1 — BB Layout (`p01_01_bb_layout.py`)
- **Action**: Creates the primary model rectangle centered on the origin.
- **Key IDs**: `BB_RECT`, `BB_top`, `BB_right`.
- **Drivers**: `widthIn`, `heightIn`.

### 🟡 Phase 1.2 — Safe Zone Offset (`p01_02_bb_offset.py`)
- **Action**: Offsets the Step 1 rectangle to create a internal safety boundary.
- **Key IDs**: `BB_corner_TL`, `BB_corner_TR`, `BB_corner_BL`, `BB_corner_BR`.
- **Relation**: Consumes `BB_top/right/bottom/left` from Step 1.
- **Driver**: `boundingboxoffset`.

## Sketch 2 — Silhouette: Shape Outline 
*Relationship: Builds the frame silhouette using an internal skeleton scaffold centered on the origin.*

### 🔴 Phase 2.1 — Projections (`p02_01_projs.py`)
- **Action**: Projects the four safe-zone corners and the offset top boundary line into sketch 2.
- **Key IDs**: `proj_off_corner_TL` (and TR, BL, BR) and `proj_off_BB_top`
- **Source**: `1_bounding-box:BB_corner_XX` and `1_bounding-box:offset_BB_top`.

### 🔴 Phase 2.2 — Anatomy (`p02_02_anatomy.py`)
- **Action**: Constructs the invisible horizontal skeleton scaffold (Hubs).
- **Key IDs**: `skel_shoulder_pin_R/L`, `skel_waist_pin_R/L`, `skel_hip_pin_R/L`.
- **Relation**: Start points (`:S`) are anchored to the **`Y_AXIS`** (Center Line). 
- **Vertical Control**: Anchored to **`ORIGIN`** or driven by **`WaistOffset`** vertical distance.
- **Drivers**: Defines the internal widths via `ShoulderSpan`, `WaistSpan`, and `HipSpan`.

### 🔴 Phase 2.3 — Silhouette Lines (`p02_03_lines.py`)
- **Action**: Places the straight horn and boundary line segments using the revised edge and horn seed locations.
- **Key IDs**: `horn_TR/TL`, `horn_BR/BL`, `top_edge`, `bottom_edge`.
- **Relation**: Snaps the 4 corner "horn starts" (`horn_XX:S`) to the **Step 3 Projections** (`proj_off_corner_XX`) while keeping the bottom-edge/horn bottoms shifted by a small `0.001` offset to avoid premature auto coincidence.
- **Topology**: Uses precise top/bottom seed offsets so the solver can establish the silhouette without unintended constraint collapse.

### 🔴 Phase 2.4 — Silhouette Arcs (`p02_04_arcs.py`)
- **Action**: Places the 4 key circular arc seeds for the silhouette outline.
- **Key IDs**: `arc_waist_R/L`, `arc_hip_R/L`.
- **Relation**: Uses midpoint/bulge seeding to place the waist and hip arcs relative to the silhouette lines.
- **Topology**: Uses shared parametric radii (`heightIn/16`) for the hip pair and the waist pair.

### 🔴 Phase 2.5 — Chain (`p02_05_chain.py`)
- **Action**: Establishes topological continuity across the silhouette.
- **Relation**: Connects adjacent arcs (e.g., `arc_waist_R:E` → `arc_hip_R:E`) into a unified clockwise chain, and also chains the horns to the arcs without issue.

### 🔴 Phase 2.6 — Horn Welds (`p02_06_horns.py`)
- **Action**: Attaches the straight horn segments to the waist/hip arcs.
- **Relation**: Welds `horn_TR:E` (tip) to `arc_waist_R:S`.

### 🔴 Phase 2.7 — Waist Pins (`p02_07_waist_pins.py`)
- **Action**: Centers the waist arcs against the skeleton for symmetry.
- **Relation**: `Coincident` constraint from `arc_waist_R :C` (center) to the Step 4 skeleton hub `skel_waist_pin_R :E`.

### 🔴 Phase 2.8 — Tangency (`p02_08_tangency.py`)
- **Action**: Smoothes the junctions between all circular arcs.
- **Constraint**: `Tangent` across all segment pairs in the loop.

### 🔴 Phase 2.9 — Horn Tangency (`p02_09_horn_tangency.py`)
- **Action**: Ensures the straight horns transition smoothly into the curved shoulders/hips.
- **Constraint**: `Tangent` between `horn_XX` and its neighboring `arc_XX`.

### 🔴 Phase 2.10 — Radius Removal (`p02_10_radius_removal.py`)
- **Action**: Deletes the Phase 5 seed dimensions to prepare for parameter injection.
- **Logic**: Releases the "training wheels" so the solver can settle into the final parametric state.

### 🔴 Phase 2.11 — Skeleton Welds (`p02_11_welds.py`)
- **Action**: Fixes the ends of the arcs to the skeletal pins in Vertical Pairs.
- **Relation**: Bottom half (Hips), then Top half (Shoulders), with an intermediate Pulse.

### 🔴 Phase 2.12 — Symmetry (`p02_12_symmetry.py`)
- **Action**: Finalizes the anatomy by forcing Left and Right hubs into equality.
- **Logic**: Independent build settling followed by a final symmetric "Snap."

### 🔴 Phase 2.13 — Parametric Drivers (`p02_13_drivers.py`)
- **Action**: Injects the final UI slider values.
- **Drivers**: `ShoulderRadius`, `WaistSpan`, `ShoulderSpan`, etc.
- **Logic**: Uses "Volatile Dimension" logic to avoid solver locking.

## Sketch 3 — Enclosure: Frame Wall
*Relationship: Projects the finalized Sketch 2 silhouette to generate the solid profile.*

### 🔵 Phase 3.1 — Enclosure Projections (`p03_01_encl_projs.py`)
- **Action**: Imports the finalized silhouette loop from Sketch 2.
- **Source**: `2_shape_outline:top_edge`, `horn_TR`, etc. (12 projected curves total).
- **Note**: Separate `proj_anchor_*` SketchPoints used to be projected here for the miter sources, but were removed — projection already creates curve endpoint vertices at each corner, so the miter sources `proj_top_edge:S` / `proj_horn_TR:S` / etc. directly.

### 🔵 Phase 3.2 — Enclosure Offset (`p03_02_encl_offset.py`)
- **Action**: Generates the structural thickness of the frame.
- **Key IDs**: `inner_proj_top_edge:S` (TL corner), `inner_proj_horn_TR:S` (TR), etc. — corners are referenced by parent-curve endpoints under the "start of next curve" convention.
- **Driver**: `frame_thickness`.

> Note: an explicit Enclosure Welds phase used to live here at 3.2 but was removed — the silhouette curves are projections that already inherit endpoint coincidences from the source loop, so explicit welds over-constrained the sketch.

### 🔵 Phase 3.3 — Inner Corner Resolve (`p03_03_inner_corner_resolve.py`)
- **Action**: Locates the 4 inner-enclosure corner SketchPoints by position and registers them under the names the miter phase expects.
- **Why**: At high `frame_thickness`, Fusion's offset merges colliding side arcs into phantom curves whose attribute API is locked, so naming the inner corners via the offset's curve endpoints fails. The corners themselves still exist as valid geometry (they're formed by intersection of straight-line offsets that never collapse) — this phase finds them by computed position and tags them directly.

### 🔵 Phase 3.4 — Enclosure Miters (`p03_04_encl_miters.py`)
- **Action**: Bridges the outer silhouette and inner enclosure.
- **Relation**: Connects parent-curve endpoints under the "start of next curve" convention — e.g. `proj_horn_TR:S` (outer TR) to `inner_proj_horn_TR:S` (inner TR), and the equivalent at TL/BR/BL.

### 🔵 Phase 3.5 — Enclosure Surround Rectangle (`p03_05_encl_surround_rect.py`)
- **Action**: Adds the surround rectangle used to cap the frame wall and finalize the profile boundary.
- **Relation**: Anchors the surround rect center to the origin while preserving its offset from the silhouette.

### **Synthesis Sequence**
After Step 16, the engine locates the closed profile in **Sketch 3** and performs the solid extrusion (`frame_depth`) into the final 3D part.
